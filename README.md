# kphp-tools123

A set of independent tools to work with KPHP compiled code (tons of *.cpp/.h* files as a result of PHP→C++ codegeneration).

So, this is not a part of the compiler, but just helpers for development.

## Tools list

Each of them has its own README and instruction usage, so follow links.

* [**kphp-inspector**](./kphp-inspector) — query and examine KPHP output folder: quickly find functions sources, analyze inferred local vars, etc

* [**kphp-diff-comparator**](./kphp-diff-comparator) — compare two KPHP outputs: see difference between two versions of one site or when a site was compiled by different KPHP versions
